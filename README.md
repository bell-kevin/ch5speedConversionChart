# ch5speedConversionChart

Write a program that displays a table of speeds in kilometers per hour with those values converted to miles per hour. The table should display the speeds from 40 kilometers per hour through 130 kilometers per hour (maximum measured speed on the German Autobahn), in increments of 10 kilometers per hour. In other words, it should display 40 kph, 50 kph, 60 kph, and so on, up to 130 kph, with the equivalent mph values. The formula to convert kph to mph is:
          MPH = KPH * 0.6214

You must use a FOR loop. Remember about the setw( ) formatting option for displaying the results. Here is how the output should look:

Ch 5 Speed Conversion 

Take a screenshot of the results.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
