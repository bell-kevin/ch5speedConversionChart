# ch5speedConversionChart
Write a program that displays a table of speeds in kilometers per hour with those values converted to miles per hour. The table should display the speeds from 40 kilometers per hour through 130 kilometers per hour (maximum measured speed on the German Autobahn), in increments of 10 kilometers per hour. In other words, it should display 40 kph, 50 kph, 60 kph, and so on, up to 130 kph, with the equivalent mph values. The formula to convert kph to mph is:           MPH = KPH * 0.6214  You must use a FOR loop. Remember about the setw( ) formatting option for displaying the results. Here is how the output should look:  Ch 5 Speed Conversion   Take a screenshot of the results.     NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.  Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.
